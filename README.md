#Stock Market Prediction

This project revolves around the application of machine learning (ML) algorithms to forecast stock market trends and prices by analyzing historical data. It aims to provide investors, traders, and financial analysts with valuable insights to support informed decision-making.

The heart of the project lies in the application of various ML models:
- Support Vector Machines (SVM) are used for classification tasks, helping to categorize stocks into different groups.
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are employed to capture temporal patterns and sequential dependencies in the data.
- Additionally, Linear Regression models are utilized to model linear relationships between features and stock prices.
